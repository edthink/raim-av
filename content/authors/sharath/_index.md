Sharath is currently working with Dr. Babak Mehran as a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Civil Engineering, University of Manitoba, Canada. He is currently working on developing demand-responsive transit systems to enhance the mobility of the older-adults. The aim is to integrate a classical optimization technique (e.g., genetic algorithm) with a machine learning approach to solve this multi-attribute problem.
