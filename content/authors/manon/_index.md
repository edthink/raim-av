Manon Prédhumeau is a Research Fellow in the School of Geography, University of Leeds, UK, and affiliated with the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA). Her work focuses on agent-based modelling and simulation of human behaviour with an application in urban mobility.

From 2018 to 2021, she did her PhD in Computer Science at Grenoble Alps University, France. She worked on modelling and simulating realistic pedestrian behaviours in shared spaces with autonomous vehicles.

As part of the RAIM project, she is currently working on modelling and simulating the mobility needs of the ageing population in UK and Canada, in order to identify the needs for demand-responsive autonomous transportation.
